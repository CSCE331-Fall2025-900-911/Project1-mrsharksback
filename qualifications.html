    <p class="employee-info">
      A good video game programmer not only possesses strong technical skills but is also creative and a team player. Through my coursework, team projects, and self-taught projects, I have been building my programming skills. These experiences have further developed my creativity skills and strengthened my team work. At Texas A&M University, I have completed several courses that provide a strong foundation for programming and game development. Specifically, in my game development course, I served as the lead game designer in a team project and was responsible for initiating the Game Design Plan, developing the story, providing direction for game play, and creating game mechanics. During this team project, I learned more about the planning stage of game development, in particular the game design document. In high school, I took AP Computer Science and Game Development/Design I and II where I completed the Unity Certified Associate Coursework and learned to program using Unity and C++. I graduated in the top ten percent from a college preparatory school and received several honors including Best Overall in AP CS Principles and Game Development I and II, and Career & Technology Student of the Year. 
      I expanded my knowledge and technical skills by attending camps where I learned C++ Programming, AI Programming in C++, and 3D Modeling. I have applied my skills to create my own games. I created gameplay systems such as top-down character controllers, random weapons with random effects, an inventory system, and random map generation using Unity. I also worked on object movement based on physics principles. These experiences have taught me more about 2D and 3D design, developing algorithms, and understanding programming languages. As a result of my education and projects, I have developed advanced proficiency in several programming languages and integrated development environments. I have a strong foundation to be successful in the video game industry.
