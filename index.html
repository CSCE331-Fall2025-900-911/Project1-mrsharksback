    What is more exciting than creating a computer program that stimulates thought, provides assistance, solves a problem or gives joy? Nothing! Programming brings ideas and imagination to life. Video games are a platform that challenge players to think critically and find creative solutions through an entertaining immersive world. For as long as I can remember, I have been intrigued not only with playing video games but learning how to create them. I wanted to understand the programming and components that go into creating games so that I could create my own games. My path has always been focused on pursuing a career in video game development.

    My name is Michael Ramirez and I design and develop video games. My professional goal is to be a programmer in the video game industry, specializing in the technical and programming aspects of game development. Currently, I am a Texas A&M University Computer Science major in the College of Engineering with a minor in Game Design and Development in the College of Performance, Visualization, and Fine Arts. One area that I am interested in is the use of generative AI along with procedural tools to create interactive and responsive non-playable characters and to create immersive virtual worlds. By combining the latest technology with thoughtful design, I want to create games that are not only entertaining but educational and impactful.
